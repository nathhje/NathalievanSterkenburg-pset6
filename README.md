# NathalievanSterkenburg-pset6

This is my final project for my course native appstudio. It's a Dutch app where you can create an account and then search for schools in the Netherlands.
You can also get more information on a specific school and "submit" for a tour of the school or "subscribe" to the news letter.
(Both submit and subscribe mean that your user data are stored in a database where they can be retrieved for further usage.)
